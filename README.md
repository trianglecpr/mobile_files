# mobile_files, the website for Triangle CPR



This is how the website is set up:

 - `index.html` is the home page
 - `content/` subdirectory that contains the content of all pages
 - `common/` subdirectory that contains common info used on all pages
 - `images/` uhmmm.

Actual content pages in `content/` directory. 

The filenames are explanatory.

- `acls.html`
- `bls.html`
- `heartsaver.html`
- `heartsaverfirstaid.html`
- `location.html`
- `policies.html`
- `contact.html`

Each of those content pages includes stuff that is common from the `common/` directory. 
Edit one of these common files and the changes show up on every page. 
**Each common file must end with '.shtml'.**

- `masthead.shtml` the left-hand navigation and logo
- `page_bottom.shtml` the bottom of the page (links to class details)
