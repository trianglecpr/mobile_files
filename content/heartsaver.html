            <h1>Heartsaver CPR</h1>
            <p>This is the CPR course designed for those who are not medical professionals, but are required to
            maintain CPR certification or simply for personal knowledge.</p>

              <p>This class is ideal for the lay-rescuer who need to respond in the event of an emergency, but are not
              in the healthcare field. This would include personal trainers, construction workers, security guards,
              teachers and other non-medical professionals.</p>
              <p>Triangle CPR provides a learning friendly environment and low student/manikin ratio to ensure ample
              hands on practice.</p>
              <p>Topics include: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Adult, Child and Infant CPR</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Foreign Body Airway Obstruction</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Use of a barrier device</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Use of an AED</p>
                </li>
              </ul></p>
              <p>Each student will receive an American Heart Association certification card upon successful completion
              of the course. If the class is being offered at your location, the content can be adjusted to meet the
              age population you serve.</p>

              <h2>CPR Where You Are</h2>
              <div class="img-wrap post-image"><img class="border" src="/images/massage.jpg" /></div>
                <p>If you have six or more participants, Triangle CPR would be glad to bring this class to you.</p>
              <h2>Note</h2>
                <p>
                <b>If you are in or entering the healthcare or dental field, please see
                <a href="/content/bls.html">Basic Life Support for the Healthcare Provider</a></b>.
                This class, Heartsaver CPR, is for lay-rescuers, and unlikely to meet the
                requirements of those in the medical industry.</p>
