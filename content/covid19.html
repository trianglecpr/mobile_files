  We are still open.
As Triangle CPR provides an essential service to support our healthcare system,
  we are officially considered exempt from the stay-at-home order.  
</p>
<p>
Under current regulations, we are able to conduct classes as long as we maintain 6 feet of 
  distance between participants and have fewer than 10 people in the facility. 
  These are measures we have already enacted.
</p>
<p>
We have relaxed our rescheduling policy.  If you have been granted an extension from your employer, or have other concerns, 
  you may wish to reschedule to a later date or suspend your registration until we have the all-clear. 
  Please also note that American Heart Association is allowing you to take a renewal class for up to 60 days 
  after your card has expired. This allows you to take the renewal class vs. initial. 
Working, or renewing your professional license, with an expired card is up to your employer/governing body. 
</p>
<p>
To accomodate healthcare professionals, we are suspending Heartsaver classes.  
  CPR and First Aid for the lay-rescuer will resume as soon as it is responsible to do so.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the regulations, no one wants to be part of the problem. 
  Measures taken:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We have made modifications to minimize contact with one another and shared surface areas.
All corrections will be made verbally and not through touch.</p></li>

<li><p>We thoroughly wipe down all equipment and surfaces between classes (including door knobs, bathroom fixtures, etc.).
We practice using a 1:1 student to manikin ratio.
There is no direct mouth to manikin contact. The lung system of each manikin has a disposable protective shield. 
  Face masks are used with a disposable one-way valve. Bag Masks are used, one per participant.</p></li>

<li><p>Latex-free gloves are provided when needed and/or upon request as is soap and hand sanitizer.</p></li>

<li><p>We have relaxed our policy on rescheduling and ask that you please stay home if you are ill.</p></li>

<li><p>If you come to class with bad cough and/or clearly feverish, you will be asked to reschedule.</p></li>
          </ul>  
<p>
Obviously we may have to make adjustments as regulations change. 
  We will keep you informed as we receive new information.
