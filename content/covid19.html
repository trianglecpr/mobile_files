<p>
As ongoing training is essential to patient care, Triangle CPR is continuing our BLS, ACLS and PALS classes as schedule.   We are making modifications based on common sense and closely monitoring ever evolving guidelines.
</p>
<p>
To conduct smaller, more frequent Healthcare Provider classes, we are suspending Heartsaver classes.  CPR and First Aid for the lay-rescuer will resume as soon as it is responsible to do so.
</p>
<p>Measures taken:
<ul>
<li>We have made modifications to minimize contact to one another and shared surface areas.
All corrections will be made verbally and not through touch.</li>

<li>Thoroughly wipe down all equipment and surfaces between classes (including door knobs, bathroom fixtures, etc.)
We practice using a 1:1 student to manikin radio
There is no direct mouth to manikin contact. The lung system of each manikin has a disposable protective shield. Face masks are used with a disposable one way valve. Bag Masks are one per participant.</li>

<li>Latex free gloves are provided when needed and/or upon request as is soap and hand sanitizer.</li>

<li>We have relaxed our policy on rescheduling and ask that you please stay home if you are ill.</li>

<li>If you come to class with bad cough and/or clearly feverish, you will be asked to reschedule.</li>
