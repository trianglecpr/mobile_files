					<p>Triangle CPR is glad to come to facilities with a minimum for four participants within the Triangle Area and six outside the region.  Classes cancelled/rescheduled with less than 48 hours notice will be charged for the minimal number. This amount cannot be applied to a future class.</p> 
				
					<p>We at Triangle CPR understand that unexpected problems can arise, and your staff may need to finish with a patient.  We will always do our best to work with you.  A prolonged delay, however, may cause the instructor to be late to any further engagement.  If the group is not ready within 20 minutes after the scheduled time, the instructor may consider that the class has been cancelled by the facility.  The minimum charge will apply. </p>
					<p>Please do not bring young children to class.</p>
