                <p>Triangle CPR is glad to come to facilities with a minimum for six participants.
                Classes cancelled/rescheduled
                with less than 48 hours notice will be charged for the minimal number. This amount
                cannot be applied to a future class.</p>
                <p>We at Triangle CPR understand that unexpected problems can arise, and your staff
                may need to finish with a patient. We will always do our best to work with you. A
                prolonged delay, however, may cause the instructor to be late to any further
                engagement. If the group is not ready within 20 minutes after the scheduled time,
                the instructor may consider that the class has been cancelled by the facility. The
                minimum charge will apply.</p>
                <p>Please do not bring young children to class.</p>

                <p>Office hours are from 9am—5pm, Monday—Friday. When the class begins outside

                the sole discretion of the instructor. If you are having difficulty finding the
                location, please call 919 851 4380 before the class begins. We will be glad to direct you.</p>
