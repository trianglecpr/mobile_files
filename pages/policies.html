      <h2>Classes conducted at your location:</h2>

      <p>Triangle CPR is glad to come to facilities with a minimum for six participants.
        Classes cancelled/rescheduled
        with less than 48 hours notice will be charged for the minimal number. This amount
        cannot be applied to a future class.</p>
      <p>We at Triangle CPR understand that unexpected problems can arise, and your staff
        may need to finish with a patient. We will always do our best to work with you. A
        prolonged delay, however, may cause the instructor to be late to any further
        engagement. If the group is not ready within 20 minutes after the scheduled time,
        the instructor may consider that the class has been cancelled by the facility. The
        minimum charge will apply.</p>
      <p>Please do not bring young children to class.</p>

      <h2>Individuals coming to Triangle CPR:</h2>

      <p>Office hours are from 9am &mdash; 5pm, Monday &mdash; Friday. When the class begins outside
                these hours, the door may not open until 20 minutes prior to class. Class will
                begin promptly as scheduled. Late arrivals may need to reschedule. This will be at
                the sole discretion of the instructor. If you are having difficulty finding the
                location, please call <a href="tel:9198514380">919 851 4380</a> before the class begins. 
                We will be glad to direct you.</p>

      <p>At Triangle CPR, we understand that the demands of your schedule can lead to a

        before incurring additional fees.
      </p>
      <p>If you find you need to cancel:

          <li>No refunds will be granted if cancellation is requested within 48 hours of the original class.</li>
          <li>No refunds will be granted for online classes once key code is sent with the conformation email.
            Funds will not transfer to any other class.</li>
          <li>All refund requests must be sent in writing to 
            <a href="mailto:info@trianglecpr.com">info@trianglecpr.com</a>.
            This will avoid confusion and provide time and date information. </li>
          <li>If a book has been sent, the actual cost of the book and postage will be
