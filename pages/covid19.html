    <h1>COVID-19 Statement</h1>
       
<p style="font-weight:bold">
  We are still open.<br/>
  Face coverings will be required in all classes.
  </p>
<p>
We have relaxed our rescheduling policy. If you have any signs and/or symptoms of illness, please reschedule.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the regulations, no one wants to be part of the problem. 
  Measures taken:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>We thoroughly wipe down all equipment and surfaces between classes (including door knobs, bathroom fixtures, etc.).
We practice using a 1:1 student to manikin ratio.
There is no direct mouth to manikin contact. 
</p></li>

<li><p>Latex-free gloves are provided when needed and/or upon request as is soap and hand sanitizer.</p></li>

<li><p>If you come to class with bad cough and/or clearly feverish, you will be asked to reschedule.</p></li>
          </ul>  
<p>
Obviously we may have to make adjustments as regulations change. 
  We will keep you informed as we receive new information.
